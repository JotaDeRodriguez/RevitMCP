# Revit MCP Design Documentation

This directory contains design documentation for the Revit MCP (Machine Conversation Protocol) integration.

## Architecture Overview

The Revit MCP integration consists of several key components that work together to provide a natural language interface to Revit models. See the [README.md](../README.md) for a high-level overview of the system architecture.

## Component Design Documents

The following documents provide detailed design specifications for each component:

1. [User Interface Design](ui_design.md) - Design of the PyRevit UI components
2. [MCP Server Design](mcp_server_design.md) - Design of the HTTP server that processes queries
3. [MCP Connector Design](mcp_connector_design.md) - Design of the component that bridges PyRevit and the server
4. [Revit API Design](revit_api_design.md) - Design of the Revit API integration

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

These documents address concerns that span multiple components:

1. **IronPython Compatibility** - Each design document includes a section on IronPython 2.7 compatibility
2. **Error Handling** - Approach to error handling and recovery
3. **Performance Optimization** - Strategies for maintaining responsive performance
4. **Security Considerations** - Measures to ensure secure operation

## Implementation Planning

The implementation is planned in phases:

1. [Detailed Implementation Roadmap](implementation_roadmap.md) - Task-level breakdown and timeline

### Phase 1: Basic Integration

- Basic PyRevit extension structure
- Simple chat interface
- MCP server with core functionality
- Basic Revit data extraction

### Phase 2: Enhanced Revit API Integration

- Comprehensive Revit data extraction
- Element selection in responses
- Transaction management
- Improved error handling

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

- Streaming responses
- Chat history
- Advanced UI features
- Plugins and extensions

## Development Practices

When contributing to this project, please follow these practices:

1. **Compatibility First** - Ensure all code works with IronPython 2.7
2. **Clear Documentation** - Document all APIs and functions
3. **Error Handling** - Implement robust error handling
4. **Testing** - Test with real Revit models
5. **Code Style** - Follow consistent code style
